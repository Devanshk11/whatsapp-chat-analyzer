## Introduction
• The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is a natural language processing (NLP)-based tool designed to analyze WhatsApp chat data and provide detailed insights into communication patterns. </br>
• By processing the chat history, the app extracts key information, including sentiment analysis, user activity, word frequency, and more, while visualizing the data in an intuitive and interactive way.</br>
• The project leverages NLP techniques, data visualization, and easy-to-use web interfaces to help users better understand large volumes of chat data, whether for personal use, business insights, or research purposes.</br>

## Objectives

• To analyze large WhatsApp chat histories and extract meaningful insights. </br>
• To provide visualizations of user activity and conversation trends over time. </br>
• To perform sentiment analysis on messages to understand the emotional tone of conversations.</br>
• To create an interactive web application that allows users to upload and analyze their chat data easily.</br>

## Features 

• **Sentiment Analysis** : Automatically classifies messages into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments using the VADER Sentiment Analysis tool from NLTK.</br>
• **Most Active Users**: Identifies the most active participants in the chat and visualizes their contributions.</br>
• **Message Statistics** : Displays statistics such as the total number of messages, most frequent words, and the distribution of messages over time.</br>
• **Word Cloud Generation** : Visualizes frequently used words in the conversation as a word cloud.</br>
• **Chat Parsing** : Reads WhatsApp chat files and cleans the data for analysis.</br>
• **Visual Insights** : Generates easy-to-understand graphs for user activity, message frequency, and sentiment trends.</br>

## Project Outcomes
• Successfully analyzed WhatsApp chat data with minimal user input.</br>
• Developed an interactive web interface where users can easily upload their chat data and receive visual feedback.</br>
• Provided insights into conversational dynamics, including who contributed the most and the overall tone of the conversation.</br>
• Created visual representations that make complex chat data easy to interpret for non-technical users.</br>
